# 🛒 GreenCart – Full Stack E-commerce Web Application

GreenCart is a fully functional e-commerce platform built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It provides a seamless and realistic online shopping experience, including product browsing, cart management, address handling, and secure order placement.

This project demonstrates not only the technical depth of full-stack development but also a strong focus on user experience, responsive design, and scalable architecture.
